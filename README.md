# Adult_Dataset

The goal of this project is to analyze the “Adult” dataset available at the [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult) Machine Learning repository. In particular, we will concentrate on the first three phases of the CRISP-DM process model - Business Understanding, Data Understanding, and Data Preparation.
